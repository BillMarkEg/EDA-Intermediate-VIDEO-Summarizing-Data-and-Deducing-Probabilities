# EDA-Intermediate-Summarizing-Data-and-Deducing-Probabilities
### some statisitcs 
<br> infer-stat -> does our sample represent population and do some hypothesis and machine learning to test some hypothesis or even make ml model
<br> IQR -> says that 50% of data (Q3 (greater than 75% of data) -Q1(gtreater than 25% of data)) distributed in x values  
<br> ex. q1 = 20 & q3 = 60 --> so IQR is 40 means that 50% of data differentiate in just 40 value from 20 to 60. so thet are 21.22.24.30.35 and so on.
<br> variance is covariance between column with itself. but its always positive as we take power of 2 of the difference. 
<br> why? as its not imp to have neg or pos relation we just wanna know the jump BUT in covariance we wanna know if its pos * neg or neg * neg or pos * pos
<br> so pos * pos => pos relationship and so on.
### Performing Exploratory Data Analysis in Spreadsheets
### univar 
<br> first -> tool menu -> add analyses option
<br> tool -> data analyses -> descrptive stat to get all analyses you may need.
<br> neg **skewness** => skewed to the left
<br> neg **kurtosis** => has lighter tail 
<br> so some vis => select data -> insert -> chart 
<br> **grouping** using pivot table => insert -> pivot table -> select data -> sum so we add height to row so total sum for each hieght then change it to count 
<br> **to get frequency** then add height to agg again but as percent of total. 
<br> **binning**/bucketing => select first value in row tables -> group selection menu -> group by 12 as binning. so from 140 - 151 and so on.
<br> select pivot data on bucketing  -> insert -> pivot chart (default : historgram) 
<br> r-click on chart of historag -> change chart type to pie chart. -> r-click add data label -> r-click on element of chart and inc font size.
<br> click on pie chart -> fields of pivot table -> values -> change it to grant of total %
